    <p>She was kind and full of care</p>
    <p>Always loving, always fair.</p>
    <p>With every step, she brought some light</p>
    <p>Like morning sun that's soft and bright.</p>
    <br>
    <p> Her voice was calm like gentle breeze,</p>
    <p>She helped to make sad hearts feel peace.</p>
    <p>She didn't want a crown or fame,</p>
    <p>She simply helped and felt no pain.</p>
    <br>
    <p>She loved the trees, the grass, the sky,</p>
    <p>She watched the birds go flying by.</p>
    <p>The kindness shining in her face</p>
    <p>Could bring the world a quiet grace.</p>
    <br>
    <p>She used her hands to help and build,</p>
    <p>Her gentle heart was always filled.</p>
    <p>She didn't shout or speak out loud,</p>
    <p>But still she stood among the proud.</p>
    <br>
    <p>She gave her time, she gave her love,</p>
    <p>She asked for nothing from above.</p>
    <p>Her strength was quiet, deep, and wide,</p>
    <p>Like rivers flowing strong inside.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Though time may pass and she is gone,</p>
    <p>Her gentle light still lingers on.</p>
    <p>For hearts like her will always be---</p>
    <p>A lily blooming endlessly.</p>
